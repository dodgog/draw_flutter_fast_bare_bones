# draw_flutter_fast_bare_bones

## List of ideas

- [ ] Implement pressure and see how that works, that's the event object
- [ ] Implement different Beziers with more degrees of freedom
        This is in how the path thing works in flutter

        Ideally, however, the current and past stroke drawing would be minimally different to prevent the
        back-propagating jiggle
- [ ] Try scaling the canvas, getting the Bezier and then drawing what's up
